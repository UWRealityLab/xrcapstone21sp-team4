<h3>GuitXR is a Magic Leap application enabling guitarists to learn faster and elevate their mastery through the use of Augmented Reality.
GuitXR aims to visualize chords and music tabs as holograms floating in front of the player, providing a hands-free experience with gaze-based menus and pitch recognition for progressing through the song. 
Experienced guitarists and beginners alike will also be able to pick up new songs and advanced techniques more easily by following visual indicators on the strings of their physical guitars, alongside guidance indicators like optimal handshape.
