Hey, Iâ€™m a CS Junior and a big AR/VR enthusiast. Iâ€™m currently the President of the Extended Reality Association at UW and was a TA for CSE490V under Douglas Lanman. Last summer I built a pair of beamsplitter-based Augmented Reality glasses from scratch! Iâ€™m enthusiastic about creating technology that grants people super-human capabilities, and looking forward to building something new that will push XR forward in this class!

Hi! Iâ€™m Rishabh, a senior majoring in computer science. I grew up in a town called Belgaum in India. Being unsure of what to do after Grade 12, I took a gap year to explore my interest in physics and computer science. Eventually, I decided to pursue a path in Computer Science which led me to UW. I am super excited about this class and am looking forward to creating something fun and innovative.

I am a senior Computer Engineering student and a big fan of building gaming and music-making computer peripherals. I transferred from Seattle Central College where I also studied Computer Science &amp; Engineering. Before that I spent three years studying public health policy in Canada and playing violin in a medieval music band. Ask me about mechanical keyboards, synthwave, or small-form-factor PCs.
