I"J<p>Meet the wonderful members of team 4 in the VR Capstone of Spring 2021…
<br />
Hey, I’m a CS Junior and a big AR/VR enthusiast. I’m currently the President of the Extended Reality Association at UW and was a TA for CSE490V under Douglas Lanman. Last summer I built a pair of beamsplitter-based Augmented Reality glasses from scratch! I’m enthusiastic about creating technology that grants people super-human capabilities, and looking forward to building something new that will push XR forward in this class!
